## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer, a graduate of the University of Maryland, and love to create practical tools using the power of computers. I'm into algorithms, webdev, low level processing, artificial intelligence, you name it! If you're also into agtech like I am, please check out the phritzda crop map repo. Tired of setting your fantasy lineup? Check out the lineupGenius repo. Keep coming back - new stuff is going to be added all the time!
