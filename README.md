## Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer, a graduate of the University of Maryland, and love to create practical tools using the power of computers. I'm into algorithms, App Dev, Web Dev, artificial intelligence, you name it! If you're also into agtech like I am, please check out the phritzda crop map repo. Tired of setting your fantasy lineup? Check out the lineupGenius repo. Keep coming back, new stuff is always being added!
